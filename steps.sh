React Js Fundamentals:
======================================================

1)JSX — Allows us to write HTML like syntax which gets
transformed to lightweightJavaScript objects.

2)Virtual DOM — A JavaScript representation of the actual
DOM.

3)React.Component — The way in which you create a new component.

4)render (method) — Describes what the UI will look like for
the particular component.

5)ReactDOM.render — Renders a React component to a DOM node.

6)state — The internal data store (object) of a component.

7)constructor (this.state) - The way in which you establish
the initial state of a component.

8)setState — A helper method used for updating the state of a
component and re-rendering the UI

9)props — The data which is passed to the child component
from the parent component.

10)propTypes — Allows you to control the presence, or types of
certain props passed to the child component.

11)defaultProps — Allows you to set default props for your component.

12)Component LifeCycle
  - componentDidMount — Fired after the component mounted
  - componentWillUnmount — Fired before the component will unmount
  - getDerivedStateFromProps - Fired when the component mounts and
whenever the props change. Used to update the state of a
component when its props change

13)Events
  - onClick
  - onSubmit
  - onChange
